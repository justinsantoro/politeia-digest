and is increasing at a rate of about $451 thousand US dollars per month.

From May 12 until May 27 there was 1 new submitted proposal, 1 proposal which
started voting and 1 proposal which concluded voting. There were 53 comments
on proposals from 14 different public keys and 138 up/down votes on comments From
24 different public keys.

### New proposals

One new proposal titled **Incentivizing BD Evangelists within the Decred Ecosystem**
was published on May 27 by user *betterfuture*.

betterfuture proposed the establishment of a Decred evangelist pilot program
through which evangelists are recruited and incentivized to set up Business
development deals.

These deals would involve the co-development of a Decred use case co-funded by
the partner and the decred Treasury with a possibility of ongoing royalties or
license fees paid by the partner to the Treasury.

Evangelists would establish contact with prospective partners and aim to negotiate
a deal to be proposed on Politeia. If these proposed BD projects are approved,
the evangelist who negotiated the deal would receive 10% of any monies paid by
the partner to the Treasury.

betterfuture requests a total $114 thousand US dollars for the program.

18 thousand dollars would go towards designing an online portal where evangelists can
apply to positions within the program to be approved by betterfuture.

96 thousand is requested to fund the project's administration for one year.
5 thousand dollars of the of the administration funds would go betterfuture each month
along with another 3 thousand per month for support staff.

### Proposals currently open for voting

On May 22nd voting commenced for jer979's proposal titled **A Journey to the Future of
Work - Telling the Decred story through Politeia**

at the time of writing, jer979's proposal to write an article about politeia
and the proposal process in return for 40 - 60 dcr (dependent on where the article
is published) has received 4,279 Yes votes and 7,204 No votes for an approval rate
of 37.3 percent with a voter participation of 27.9%.

This has been a contentious proposal with discussion taking place both on reddit
and Politeia. Early on in voting, Dustorf commented expressing support for jer979
and the proposal quickly garnered a 60% approval rate. This prompted a post on
reddit criticizing the proposal.

fiach-dubh commented to highlight jer979s previous engagement with IOTA and expressed
fear of a bait and switch.

Jer979 responded with some context around their time at IOTA which
appears to have persuaded fiach-dubh to support the proposal, while Dustorf
seems to have rescinded his support.

Other discussions sparked by this proposal concern the merit of this kind of
single article relationship and the reasons why contractor payments are denominated
in US Dollars.

The proposal's approval rate initially hovered around 60% until a block of 3,992 no
votes pushed it down to 38%.

Voting on this proposal closes on May 29th.

### Approved proposals

On May 13th voting on the proposal to Decentralize Treasury Spending concluded.
This proposal described and sought approval for a plan to decentralize control of
Treasury spending by requiring each month's outgoing transactions to be approved
by an on-chain stakeholder vote.

The proposal was approved handily with a 97.5 approval rate, receiving 8,958 yes votes
and 231 no votes, with 22.5% participation.

15 duplicate votes for this proposal were recorded in the Politeia journal repo.
This was due to a bug in the code responsible for checking incoming votes against
memory cache. The bug was identified with the first duplicate vote and has since
been fixed.

### Other news

In other news, the amended Decred constitution is now in place within the decred docs.
Check it out by clicking the link above, or in the description.

On may 21st the proposal site was updated with improvements to the front end
such as an improved list view, continuous loading while scrolling, and the removal
of the "all proposals" tab.

The backend was also updated with some performance improvements, bug fixes,
and an added endpoint for non-admins to lookup usernames by public key.

That concludes this Politeia digest. This video is an experiment with the goal
of providing and alternative means for stakeholders to ingest the information
