### New proposals

One new proposal titled **Incentivizing BD Evangelists within the Decred Ecosystem**
was published on May 27 by user *betterfuture*. (`evangelist/full_capture.png`)

betterfuture proposed the establishment of a Decred evangelist pilot program
through which evangelists are recruited and incentivized to set up Business
development deals.(`evangelist/establishment.png`)

These deals would involve the co-development of a Decred use case co-funded by
the partner and the decred Treasury with a possibility of ongoing royalties or
license fees paid by the partner to the Treasury.
Evangelists would establish contact with prospective partners and aim to negotiate
a deal to be proposed on Politeia. If these proposed BD projects are approved,
the evangelist who negotiated the deal would receive 10% of any monies paid by
the partner to the Treasury. (`evangelist/job_description.png`)

betterfuture requests a total $114 thousand US dollars for the program.
18 thousand dollars would go towards designing an online portal where evangelists can
apply to positions within the program to be approved by betterfuture.
96 thousand is requested to fund the project's administration for one year.
5 thousand dollars of the of the administration funds would go betterfuture each month
along with another 3 thousand per month for support staff. (`evangelist/reward_structure.png`)

fiach-dubh {pronounced: *fee ah* **ch** *_ dub*} commented to highlight jer979s
previous engagement with IOTA and expressed fear of a bait and switch. (`fiachdub_criticism_1.png + fiachdub_criticism_2`)

Jer979 responded with some context around their time at IOTA which
appears to have persuaded fiach-dubh to support the proposal, while Dustorf
seems to have rescinded his support. (`jer_response_iota.png + fiachdub_support.png + dustorf_recind.png`)

The proposal's approval rate initially hovered around 60% until a block of 3,992 no
votes pushed it down to 38%.

memory cache. The bug was identified with the first duplicate vote and has since
been fixed. (`bug_full.png + bug_1.png + bug_2.png`)
